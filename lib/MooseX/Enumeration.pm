=head1 NAME

MooseX::Enumeration - a native attribute trait for enums

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Given this class:

   package MyApp::Result {
      use Moose;
      use Types::Standard qw(Enum);
      has status => (
         is        => "rw",
         isa       => Enum[qw/ pass fail /],
      );
   }

It's quite common to do this kind of thing:

   if ( $result->status eq "pass" ) { ... }

But if you're throwing strings around, it can be quite easy to mistype
them:

   if ( $result->status eq "apss" ) { ... }

And the comparison silently fails. Instead, let's define the class like
this:

   package MyApp::Result {
      use Moose;
      use Types::Standard qw(Enum);
      has status => (
         traits    => ["Enumeration"],
         is        => "rw",
         isa       => Enum[qw/ pass fail /],
         handles   => [qw/ is_pass is_fail /],
      );
   }

So you can use the class like this:

   if ( $result->is_pass ) { ... }

Yay!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This attribute trait makes it easier to work with enumerated types in
L<Moose>. (Hopefully a L<Moo> implementation will follow soon.)

It will only work on attributes which have an enum type constraint.
This may be a L<Type::Tiny::Enum> or may be a type constraint defined
using Moose's built-in enum types.

=head2 Type Constraint Shortcut

This trait gives you a shortcut for specifying an enum type constraint:

   has status => (
      traits    => ["Enumeration"],
      is        => "rw",
      enum      => [qw/ pass fail /],   # instead of isa
   );

=head2 Delegation

The trait also allows you to delegate "is" to the attribute value.

   # the most longhanded form...
   #
   has status => (
      traits    => ["Enumeration"],
      is        => "rw",
      enum      => [qw/ pass fail /],
      handles   => {
         is_pass  => ["is", "pass"],
         is_fail  => ["is", "fail"],
      }
   );

Note that above, we might have called the delegated method
C<< "did_pass" >> instead of C<< "is_pass" >>. You can call it what you
like.

To save typing, we offer some shorthands for common patterns.

   has status => (
      traits    => ["Enumeration"],
      is        => "rw",
      enum      => [qw/ pass fail /],
      handles   => {
         is_pass  => "is_pass",
         is_fail  => "is_fail",
      }
   );

In the hashref values, we implicitly split on the first underscore, so
C<< "is_pass" >> is equivalent to C<< ["is", "pass"] >>.

This is still repetitive, so how about...

   has status => (
      traits    => ["Enumeration"],
      is        => "rw",
      enum      => [qw/ pass fail /],
      handles   => [ "is_pass", "is_fail" ],
   );

If an arrayref of delegates is given, it mapped like this:

   my %delegate_hash = map { $_ => $_ } @delegate_array;

We can still go one better...

   has status => (
      traits    => ["Enumeration"],
      is        => "rw",
      enum      => [qw/ pass fail /],
      handles   => 1,
   );

This will create a delegated method for each value in the enumeration.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

As of version 0.003, C<< $obj->is_pass >> actually benchmarks I<faster>
than C<< $obj->status eq "pass" >>. The latter comparison can be
accelerated using L<MooseX::XSAccessor> but this module can not (yet)
provide an XS version for C<is_pass>. :-(
